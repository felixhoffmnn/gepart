	abstract = {On-line social networks publish information on a high volume of real-world events almost instantly, becoming a primary source for breaking news. Some of these real-world events can end up having a very strong impact on on-line social networks. The effect of such events can be analyzed from several perspectives, one of them being the intensity and characteristics of the collective activity that it produces in the social platform. We research 5,234 real-world news events encompassing 43 million messages discussed on the Twitter microblogging service for approximately 1 year. We show empirically that exogenous news events naturally create collective patterns of bursty behavior in combination with long periods of inactivity in the network. This type of behavior agrees with other patterns previously observed in other types of natural collective phenomena, as well as in individual human communications. In addition, we propose a methodology to classify news events according to the different levels of intensity in activity that they produce. In particular, we analyze the most highly active events and observe a consistent and strikingly different collective reaction from users when they are exposed to such events. This reaction is independent of an event’s reach and scope. We further observe that extremely high-activity events have characteristics that are quite distinguishable at the beginning stages of their outbreak. This allows us to predict with high precision, the top 8\% of events that will have the most impact in the social network by just using the first 5\% of the information of an event’s lifetime evolution. This strongly implies that high-activity events are naturally prioritized collectively by the social network, engaging users early on, way before they are brought to the mainstream audience.},

	abstract = {The analysis of social sentiment expressed on the Web is becoming increasingly relevant to a variety of applications, and it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms which drive the evolution of sentiments in one way or another, in order to be able to predict these changes in the future. In this paper, we study the dynamics of news events and their relation to changes of sentiment expressed on relevant topics. We propose a novel framework, which models the behavior of news and social media in response to events as a convolution between event's importance and media response function, specific to media and event type. This framework is suitable for detecting time and duration of events, as well as their impact and dynamics, from time series of publication volume. These data can greatly enhance events analysis; for instance, they can help distinguish important events from unimportant, or predict sentiment and stock market shifts. As an example of such application, we extracted news events for a variety of topics and then correlated this data with the corresponding sentiment time series, revealing the connection between sentiment shifts and event dynamics.},

	abstract = {Text classification is the most fundamental and essential task in natural language processing. The last decade has seen a surge of research in this area due to the unprecedented success of deep learning. Numerous methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics have been proposed in the literature, raising the need for a comprehensive and updated survey. This paper fills the gap by reviewing the state-of-the-art approaches from 1961 to 2021, focusing on models from traditional models to deep learning. We create a taxonomy for text classification according to the text involved and the models used for feature extraction and classification. We then discuss each of these categories in detail, dealing with both the technical developments and benchmark datasets that support tests of predictions. A comprehensive comparison between different techniques, as well as identifying the pros and cons of various evaluation metrics are also provided in this survey. Finally, we conclude by summarizing key implications, future research directions, and the challenges facing the research area.},

Many machine learning approaches have achieved surpassing results in natural language processing. The success of these learning algorithms relies on their capacity to understand complex models and non-linear relationships within data. However, finding suitable structures, architectures, and techniques for text classification is a challenge for researchers. In this paper, a brief overview of text classification algorithms is discussed. This overview covers different text feature extractions, dimensionality reduction methods, existing algorithms and techniques, and evaluations methods.

In this paper, we study the problem of quantifying and inferring the political leaning of Twitter users. We formulate political leaning inference as a convex optimization problem that incorporates two ideas: (a) users are consistent in their actions of tweeting and retweeting about political issues, and (b) similar users tend to be retweeted by similar audience. We then apply our inference technique to 119 million election-related tweets collected in seven months during the 2012 U.S. presidential election campaign. On a set of frequently retweeted sources, our technique achieves 94 percent accuracy and high rank correlation as compared with manually created labels. By studying the political leaning of 1,000 frequently retweeted sources, 232,000 ordinary users who retweeted them, and the hashtags used by these sources, our quantitative study sheds light on the political demographics of the Twitter population, and the temporal dynamics of political polarization as events unfold.},

	abstract = {Every day a large amount of text is produced during public discourse. Some of this text is produced by actors whose political colour is very obvious. However, though many actors cannot clearly be associated with a political party, their statements may be biased towards a speciﬁc party. Identifying such biases is crucial for political research as well as for media consumers, especially when analysing the inﬂuence of the media on political discourse and vice versa. In this study, we investigate the extent to which political party afﬁliation can be predicted from textual content. Results indicate that automated classiﬁcation of political afﬁliation is possible with an accuracy better than chance, even across different text domains. We propose methods to better interpret these results, and ﬁnd that features not related to political policies, such as speech sentiment, can be discriminative and thus exploited by text analysis models.},

	abstract = {Twitter is well recognized as a microblogging site, an online social network (OSN), and increasingly as a digital news platform. With the changing media usage behavior over the past decade, political actors have now recognized the need to enrich their election campaign efforts by including social media strategies. However, previous research has shown that users behave heterogeneously in online political discussions. To better understand how users behave and interact in such debates, we conduct an exploratory study to identify emergent user roles from Twitter data. We develop a dynamic selection query to collect a representative data set on the German federal election of 2017. We define features of structure, function, and time for Twitter discussions and conduct a cluster analysis to derive eleven emergent roles from the 30,553 most active users. We then refine those roles by further data-driven analyses to enhance and deepen their understanding. Our results indicate dominance of the online discussion by the populist party Alternative für Deutschland. We also find that media outlets and political parties show somewhat similar behavior, and that the offline popularity of prestigious actors is extended into the online world.},

	abstract = {Intra-party politics has long been neglected due to lacking data sources. While we have a good understanding of the dynamics of ideological competition between parties, we know less about how individuals or groups inside parties influence policy, leadership selection and coalition bargaining. These questions can only be answered if we can place individual politicians and sub-party groups like factions on the same dimensions as in inter-party competition. This task has been notoriously difficult, as most existing measures either work on the party level, or are in other ways determined by the party agenda. Social media is a new data source that allows analyzing positions of individual politicians in partycentered systems, as it is subject to limited party control. I apply canonical correspondence analysis to account for hierarchical data structures and estimate multidimensional positions of the Twitter accounts of 498 Members of the German Bundestag based on more than 800,000 tweets since 2017. To test the effect of intra-party actors on their relative ideological placement, I coded the faction membership of 247 Twitter users in the Bundestag. I show that Twitter text reproduces party positions and dimensions. Members of factions are more likely to represent their faction’s positions, both on the cultural and the economic dimension.},
